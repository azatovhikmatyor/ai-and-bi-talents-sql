**Task 1:**

Write an SQL query to retrieve the database name, schema name, table name, column name, and column data type for all tables across all databases in a SQL Server instance. Ensure that system databases (`master`, `tempdb`, `model`, `msdb`) are excluded from the results.

---

**Task 2:**

Write a stored procedure that retrieves all stored procedure and function names along with their schema names and parameters (if they exist), including parameter data types and maximum lengths. The procedure should accept a database name as an optional parameter. If a database name is provided, it should return the information for that specific database; otherwise, it should retrieve the information for all databases in the SQL Server instance.
